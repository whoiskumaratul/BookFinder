# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- For building a book finder website in React.js, consider these approaches and steps as hints to guide your development process:

    Component Structure and State Management:
        Create components such as SearchBar, BookList, BookDetails, etc.
        Use React's state management (useState and useEffect hooks) to handle user input, search results, and data fetching.

  - For Run this project
  - pull this code in your system
